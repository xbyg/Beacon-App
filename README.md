# Overview
This is an Android application written in Kotlin and developed for [Beacon](https://www.beacon.com.hk/2011/index.php). Its aim is to provide a concise user interface and a more convenient way to use the funtions listed below!  

### Functions
* Viewing the introductions and courses of all Beacon tutors
* Viewing and exchanging lessons after logging in Beacon account
* Viewing locations of Beacon branch schools

More is coming......

### How does it work?
This app makes http requests to Beacon server and scrapes informations from HTML from server's response and then it will display those items after sorting.

_**P.S. Whether user's password is correct or not is only determined by server's response**_
